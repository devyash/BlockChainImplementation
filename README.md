# Block chain implementation in Java

The functionality of this code is limited to a simple block chain and a wallet. The main aim of this project was to understand the internal workings of Bitcoin and other similar blockchain technologies. The code was written in Java from scratch for a course in Digital currencies.

#Internal structure

Instruction
- Open the wallet application and add your private key
- Sign a transaction in the form given in the same transaction.txt file
- Copy the transaction signed and open the txlb program.
- The txlb program needs you to first add the user public key and then Add the transactions to the program.
- Only valid transactions with corrected signature are appened to the blockchain.


##Run
- Make sure you have java installed
- type `make`
- To run the transaction block `java txlbk`.
- To run the wallet `java wallet` in another terminal.
- type `I` to turn on the interative mode.
